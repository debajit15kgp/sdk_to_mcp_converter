# Azure MCP Server

Auto-generated MCP server for the azure SDK.

## Overview

This MCP server provides AI assistants with access to azure functionality through the Model Context Protocol.

## Features

- **10 Tools**: Execute azure operations
- **1 Resources**: Access azure data
- **Authentication**: Secure credential management
- **Error Handling**: Robust error reporting

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Configure authentication (see Configuration section)

3. Run the server:
```bash
python mcp_server.py
```

## Configuration

### Option 1: Azure CLI Authentication (Recommended for Development)

1. Install Azure CLI: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli
2. Login to Azure: `az login`
3. Set your subscription: `az account set --subscription "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"`

### Option 2: Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables:

- `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID`: Your Azure subscription ID (required)
- `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`: Azure service principal client ID (optional, for service principal auth)
- `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`: Azure service principal client secret (optional, for service principal auth)
- `AZURE_TENANT_ID`: Azure tenant ID (optional, for service principal auth)

### Option 3: Configuration File

Update the `config.json` file with your Azure credentials:

```json
{
  "subscription_id": "YOUR_AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID",
  "credentials": {
    "azure_client_id": "YOUR_AZURE_CLIENT_ID",
    "azure_client_secret": "YOUR_AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET",
    "azure_tenant_id": "YOUR_AZURE_TENANT_ID"
  }
}
```

### Authentication Methods

The server supports multiple authentication methods in order of preference:

1. **Service Principal Authentication**: Uses `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`, `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`, and `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
2. **Default Azure Credential**: Uses Azure CLI, managed identity, or other Azure authentication methods

### Troubleshooting

If you see the error "Parameter 'subscription_id' must not be None":

1. Make sure you have set `AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID` environment variable
2. Or update the `subscription_id` field in `config.json`
3. Or run `az login` and `az account set --subscription "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"`
